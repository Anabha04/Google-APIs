# APIs
WHAT IS AN API?
An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules or protocols that enables software applications to communicate with each other to exchange data, features and functionality. APIs also give application owners a simple, secure way to make their application data and functions available to departments within their organization.

<u>Phase-1</u>
GOAL: To use Tasty recipe API from rapid API to build a recipe website and understand how API's work.

Progress: The website has been succesfully made. The user can search for a desired dish and the recipe will be shown.

Setbacks: Overcame errors in code and used API keys properly.

Insight: We learned how APIs are used and their role. We could access the data of "Tasty" through the tasty API and display it on our own webpage. We learned about response codes that are displayed in terminal.
